# Compiler-Design-Semester-6
 Implemented a Mini C Compiler that was capable of handling if, for, while constructs and basic C operations and various expressions.
 Given a source program in C, the compiler built is capable of generating symbol table, abstract syntax tree, intermediate code and the target assembly code.
 The languages used for building this compiler are C, Lex and Yacc.
